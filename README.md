The academic world is populated primarily by dreamers, by builders and by thinkers. By means of a cruel hoax, many academic disciplines press these scholars to peddle their research ideas in the manner of a salesman to win academic grants. Game of Grants makes the process of connecting researchers with funding simpler and more dignified. When a match is found, the RFP, proposal, researcher(s) and investor(s) are bound into a Smart Contract that handles the funding.
